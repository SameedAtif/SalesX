## Introduction

SalesX is a next-gen Point of Sales system, built using Electron and ReactJS.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To view the SQLite database, you will most likely need [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).

To setup and run the program:

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed and updated.
2. From the project root directory, run:

    `npm install`

3. To start only React version, run:

    `npm run react-start`

4. To start the complete app, run:

    `npm run start`

## Packaging/Building

To build a platform specific release, you need to be on that platform (or at least that's what I think). Run:

`npm run build`

To configure build options, see [electron-builder configuration docs](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration).

I personally can't recommend Create React App for Electron development. You can't use native node modules with Create React App [0]. This way Electron becomes just a Chromium window. I would recommend Electron Forge[1] with the React template[2] or as you mentioned Electron React Boilerplate [3]. 

The React template of Electron Forge is much less opinionated about react, but delivers a lot of Electron goodies like building and publishing of packages. It also comes with electron-compile[4]. Which lets you use a plethora of languages for Electron development.

Electron React Boilerplate on the other hand is much more similar to Create React App in regard to project structure and react development. But it is not as advanced as electron-forge in regard to electron.
